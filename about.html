                HostU is a Northwestern startup founded by three students. Our goal is to address the struggle to find reliable, 
                short-term, subletting in Evanston. We have seen firsthand the problems that arise with housing over the summer, 
                and we want to make it easy to find subletters or to find a place to live. With one-year leases being the only 
                type of lease offered in Evanston, we understand the difficulties that students have during the three months of 
                summer. We are creating a platform that eliminates the stress of using countless different routes in order to secure
                a sublet. With HostU, finding your summer housing, or renting your room out over the summer is becoming much simpler 
                and easier.
